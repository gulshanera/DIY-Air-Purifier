# DIY Smart Air Purifier
A low-cost **DIY Smart Air Purifier** that automatically adjusts fan speed based on real-time **PM<sub>2.5</sub>** concentration. The purifier uses a **HEPA filter** with a DC fan mounted on top and is designed to provide adaptive air cleaning for indoor environments.

This project includes both the **hardware setup** and **Arduino-based control code**, and is intended to be fully open-source for anyone to replicate or improve.

## Features
**Real-Time Monitoring** – Continuously monitors air quality using a PM<sub>2.5</sub> sensor.  
**Automatic Fan Control** – Adjusts fan speed dynamically according to PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels.  
**Energy Efficient** – Runs at lower speeds when air quality is good, saving power.  
**HEPA Filtration** – Effective particle removal for healthier indoor air.  
**Open Source** – Hardware design, circuit, and code freely available.  

## Hardware Requirements
**PM<sub>2.5</sub> Sensor** - Sensirion's SEN50  
**HEPA Filter** - 20cm diameter, 29cm height(Standard MI air purifier Filter) 
**DC/AC Fan** 120mm*120mm, 12V DC Fan  
**Microcontroller** Arduino Nano  
**Power supply** L298N Motor Driver  
**Display** 0.96inch OLED display
